The project was endorsed by Activision, who now hold the copyright for Infocom's material.</p><p>Whenever possible we have stayed faithful to the original printed Invisiclues booklets. Where both in-game and printed versions were available we have used the printed clues, as these were generally more detailed. Printing errors have been corrected whenever possible. The files have been formatted to display correctly on any screen with a width of at least 80 characters. </p><p>The home of the PRIZM project is <b>www.waitingforgo.com</b>. There you can download different versions of the files, with or without sample transcripts and missing documentation, and grouped by various classifications (unfortunately, limitations within the Z-Machine prevent all the invisiclues being packaged into one big file).</p>"
